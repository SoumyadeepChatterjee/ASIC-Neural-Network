# Our first Optimization 'compile' is intended to      
# produce a design that will meet hold-time            
# under worst-case conditions:                         
#    - slowest process corner                        
#    - highest operating temperature and lowest Vcc  
#    - expected worst case clock skew                
#---------------------------------------------------------
#---------------------------------------------------------
# Set the current design to the top level instance name 
# to make sure that you are working on the right design
# at the time of constraint setting and compilation
